## Kodachrome gallery
This image gallery is made with gatsby.js, I wanted to archive some personal images I had collected throughout the years and display them in a manner similar to traditional contact sheets. The significance of this project is to programmatically create image gallery pages without hard coding images into html or having to import individual image files into jsx components.
